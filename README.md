This is my professional portfolio website, created for the CS563 - Intro to Web Development class at PSU. It was made using HTML, CSS and some Javascript. 
It contains an about page with an introduction as well as a skill/education section. There is also a project page where I show off all the projects I've worked on in the Computer Science program.  
External library: Bootstrap, Jquery.
